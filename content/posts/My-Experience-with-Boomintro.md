# My Experience with Boomintro.com

## An Idea Sown

Many months ago, I was having a long conversation on WhatsApp with a good friend. He was telling me about his latest business ventures and how he was using AI to help him create some really interesting business opportunities. It was interesting to me because I had been mulling around a way to create a little extra income for my family and it scratched an itch that I had in regards to creating things. 

I've been a long time creator of all kinds of things over the years. From websites to arcade cabinets to go-karts and mini-bikes, I've always enjoyed making things. I've made all kinds of wild projects. Drawing robots, laser engravers, an arduino horn prank machine (ask me about it sometime), and more. I love the process of creating something from nothing. A little unique always helps.

But I've never really thought of monetizing this skill. I've never even thought about it seriously... I just enjoy doing it.
