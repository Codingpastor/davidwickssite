# About

## Who I Am

I'm a pastor, developer, builder, and creator who loves solving problems. With training as a counselor and a background in molecular biology, I've spent my life combining technical skills with people skills.

**What I do:**
- **Custom Software Development** – Building web apps, automation tools, and digital solutions
- **Physical Repairs & Fabrication** – Fixing vintage electronics, building furniture, welding projects, and creating custom solutions
- **Counseling & Consulting** – Helping people and organizations work through challenges
- **Problem-Solving** – If you can imagine it, I can probably figure out how to build it

I believe the best way to get something working is to throw something out there, refine it, debug, and try again. I love learning, creating new things, and truly believe just about anything that can be dreamed up can be created.
