# Want to work together on something?

If you have an idea and you want to make it happen but you just don't know where to start, reach out to me. I've been a creative thinker who loves to solve problems my whole life. One of my strengths... and the thing that drives some people crazy about me is that I just don't quit. Reach out to me at [contact](/contact/). I love a challenge.

## How much do I charge?

If you are a ministry or an non-profit and need some technical help or website development, I will do what I can with the time I have no charge. If it's a bigger project we can talk about compensation.

For other projects, my goal is to see great things created and learn everything I can. We can talk numbers after we brainstorm together.
