# Let's Build Something Together

Have an idea you want to bring to life but don't know where to start? That's where I thrive. I'm a creative problem-solver who loves tackling challenges—and I don't quit until we find a solution that works.

Whether it's a custom software project, a technical challenge, or something that needs to be built from scratch, I'm here to figure it out with you. [Let's talk](/contact/) about what you need.

## Supporting Ministries & Non-Profits

**I have a heart for helping ministries, churches, and non-profit organizations.** 

Too often, smaller organizations face technical challenges but lack the budget for professional help. I understand that, having served in ministry for over a decade. That's why I offer special support for non-profits:

### What I Offer Non-Profits:

**Free Consultation & Planning**
- Discovery sessions to understand your needs
- Technical feasibility assessments
- Strategic planning for digital initiatives
- No-cost brainstorming and problem-solving

**Discounted Development Services**
- Significantly reduced rates for custom software
- Website development and maintenance
- Automation tools to save staff time
- Database and system setup

**Pro Bono Work (When Available)**
- Small technical fixes and troubleshooting
- Website updates and maintenance
- Training and support for your team
- Emergency technical assistance

### Types of Projects I Love:

- **Church management systems** - Custom tools for volunteer scheduling, member management, or communication
- **Donation platforms** - Streamlined giving solutions
- **Event registration systems** - Managing camps, conferences, or community events
- **Educational tools** - Resources for teaching, discipleship, or training
- **Outreach automation** - Systems to help you reach more people effectively
- **Data migration** - Moving from old systems to new platforms

### My Commitment:

If you're a ministry or non-profit, reach out even if you think you can't afford help. Let's have a conversation about what you need, and I'll do everything I can to make it work within your constraints. 

I believe technology should serve the mission, not hinder it. If you're doing good work in the world, I want to help you do it better.

## Working With Businesses & Entrepreneurs

For commercial projects, I bring the same passion for problem-solving and creating excellent solutions. My [services page](/services/) outlines standard offerings and pricing.

But here's the thing: I care more about building great things and partnering on interesting projects than following rigid pricing structures. If you have something creative, challenging, or unique—let's talk. I'm flexible and love collaborating with people who are passionate about what they're building.

## Why Partner With Me?

**I Don't Quit** - Some people find it maddening, but I'll keep working until we solve the problem. I don't give up easily.

**Creative Problem-Solving** - I've spent my life finding solutions where others see dead ends. I love the challenge of figuring out what others say can't be done.

**Diverse Experience** - From molecular biology to pastoral ministry, from counseling to coding, my varied background means I approach problems from unique angles.

**Genuine Care** - Whether you're a church on a shoestring budget or a business with resources, I invest personally in seeing your project succeed.

**Honest Communication** - I'll tell you what's realistic, what will work, and what won't. No overselling, no surprises.
