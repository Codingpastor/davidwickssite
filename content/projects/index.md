# Here's some other projects I have on the go:

## Digital Detox Website   

I am currently developing a website that helps people break their addiction to their phones. It will be a customized 21-day email campaign that requires daily check-ins otherwise the service stops and the user needs to pay again in order to complete. It focuses on personal agency and mindfulness.

## Hockey Gear Check

<https://hockeygearcheck.com/>

This is a very simple website that I developed partly out of necessity and partly out of wanting to see how much I could create very quickly using claude.ai. I am very impressed with how easy it was to create a simple page. 

It's basically an online checklist geared to help young players ensure that they have all of their gear packed and ready for their next game. 

## Father Trucker

<https://thefathertrucker.ca/>

This is a site I am helping to build for a a ministry to truckers. The goal was to be simple, fast and mobile friendly. This is definitely a case of building the airplane as we fly it.
