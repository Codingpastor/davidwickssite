# Here's some other projects I have on the go:

## AI Agent Test Page

As I mention below, I've been learning a tonne about developing and deploying conversational AI agents using Elevenlabs. I have used their widgets, developed a custom working wordpress plugin (I hope you can see it in action soon) as well as a simple custom web interface for their agents using javascript/vite. I think that this is a marketable skill that will be worth something to the right customers. With that in mind, I've created a little "sales" page where a potential customer could try out an AI agent. You can try out this page and an agent [here](https://agents.davidwicks.site/). I'm sure you'll enjoy talking to Tony about your plumbing.

## Digital Detox Website   

I am currently developing a website that helps people break their addiction to their phones. It will be a customized 21-day customized email campaign that requires daily check-ins otherwise the service stops and the user needs to pay again in order to complete. It focuses on personal agency and mindfulness instead of overbearing and obtrusive accountability apps. It utilizes wordpress for the webpage and payment system (woocommerce) and make.com for the backend and automated emails. AI is used to personalize the emails wia API calls in make.com.

I'll post the link here when complete.

## Conversational AI Agents

I am helping to develop a series of websites that use conversational AI agents based off of [elevenlabs](https://try.elevenlabs.io/davidwicks) incredible product. The agents are geared towards helping people solve real world problems and personal issues. The first one being created is geared towards helping Christians deepen their relationship with Christ. I'll post a link when the project is a little bit closer to being completed. The workhorse of this project is a custom built wordpress plugin that interacts with the elevenlabs agents. 

## Hockey Gear Check

<https://hockeygearcheck.com/>

This is a very simple website that I developed partly out of necessity and partly out of wanting to see how much I could create very quickly using claude.ai. I am very impressed with how easy it was to create a simple page. 

It's basically an online checklist geared to help young players ensure that they have all of their gear packed and ready for their next game. 

## Father Trucker

<https://thefathertrucker.ca/>

This is a site I am helping to build for a a ministry to truckers. The goal was to be simple, fast and mobile friendly. This is definitely a case of building the airplane as we fly it.
