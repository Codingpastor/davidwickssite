      <description>Here is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about for a long, long time: train yourself to be godly.&#xA;The Common (Flawed) Assumption About Spiritual Growth In my early years, I adopted a view of spiritual growth that goes something like this:&#xA;Say a sinner&amp;rsquo;s prayer Jesus comes into your heart Grow closer to God over time Go to heaven I can&amp;rsquo;t argue with steps one and two. Nor could I argue with steps 3 and 4.</description>

      <description>The Hidden Burden: How Administrative Tasks Drain Pastoral Energy In the quiet hours before dawn, Pastor David sits at his desk reviewing reports, making decisions on facility issues, and finalizing next month&amp;rsquo;s ministry calendar. His sermon preparation—the work he feels truly called to do—sits untouched in the corner.&#xA;Ok a little theatric, but not far from the truth on some days.&#xA;Despite having dedicated staff and volunteers who handle many day-to-day tasks, this scene plays out in countless churches across the country, where pastors still find themselves shouldering administrative responsibilities that pull them away from their primary calling.</description>

      <description>Faith in the Age of AI: Can Technology Help Us Shepherd the Flock? The world is changing at lightning speed, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer science fiction – it&amp;rsquo;s becoming part of our daily lives. From how we shop to how we get news, AI is everywhere. As people of faith, and particularly as pastors, this rapid advancement prompts important questions: How do we engage with this powerful technology?</description>

      <description>The Curious Case of the Time-Blind AI: Lessons from Building an ElevenLabs Agent Large language models (LLMs) are amazing, but they have a funny quirk: they don&amp;rsquo;t really understand the passage of time within a conversation. This became super clear when we were developing an AI agent with ElevenLabs. You can learn more about their product here: ElevenLabs conversational AI agents. I strongly suggest you check them out. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty amazing service.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s some other projects I have on the go: OneActionStep.com This is a simple web app I built to help people take action on their goals. Users can create an account, set a goal, and then receive email reminders to take small steps towards that goal. The idea is to make it easy for people to build positive habits and make progress over time. Check it out: One Action Step. The unique thing about this site is that it uses a credit system to encourage users to take action.</description>

      <description>About I am a pastor. I am a hobbyist programer, tinkerer, builder and problem solver. I am also trained as a counselor. I love learning and I love creating new things. I believe the best way to get something working is to just throw something out there, refine, debug and then try again. I love all things creative and truly believe just about anything that can be dreamed up can be created.</description>
