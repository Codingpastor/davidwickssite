It will be a customized 21-day customized email campaign that requires daily check-ins otherwise the service stops and the user needs to pay again in order to complete. It focuses on personal agency and mindfulness instead of overbearing and obtrusive accountability apps. It utilizes wordpress for the webpage and payment system (woocommerce) and make.com for the backend and automated emails. AI is used to personalize the emails wia API calls in make.com.
