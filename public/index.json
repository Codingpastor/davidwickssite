[{"categories":["pastoring"],"content":"Faith in the Age of AI: Can Technology Help Us Shepherd the Flock? The world is changing at lightning speed, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer science fiction – it’s becoming part of our daily lives. From how we shop to how we get news, AI is everywhere. As people of faith, and particularly as pastors, this rapid advancement prompts important questions: How do we engage with this powerful technology? Can it be a tool for ministry, or does it pose risks we need to carefully consider? As a pastor myself, I’ve been pondering how AI might intersect with my calling. I see two main areas where AI could potentially play a role: easing the administrative burdens of ministry and, perhaps more profoundly, helping us connect with and care for our congregations more effectively. But alongside any potential benefits, we must tread thoughtfully and ethically.

Scheduling meetings, coordinating volunteers, sending communications, and managing resources – these tasks are necessary but can consume valuable time that could be spent in prayer, study, or directly ministering to people. Could AI help? Tools are emerging that can automate scheduling, draft initial communications (like event reminders or newsletters), and manage calendars. But the area I find most intriguing, and perhaps most complex, is database management – what I sometimes call (with pastoral affection!) “sheep management.” Imagine moving beyond simple contact lists. Could AI help us, ethically and with appropriate permissions, keep better track of our congregants’ journeys? Noting significant life events, like a birth, a new job, or, sadly, a loss in the family, prompting timely pastoral care. Identifying patterns, like someone who hasn’t attended in a while, suggesting a need for a personal check-in. Understanding engagement levels to better connect people with relevant groups or service opportunities. The goal here isn’t cold efficiency but liberating time and providing insights to enable more focused, personal, and timely pastoral care. It’s about using tools to help us better fulfill the shepherd’s call to know and care for the flock.

AI in Pastoral Care Beyond administration, could AI actually help foster a deeper sense of connection within the church community? This idea requires even more careful thought. AI’s ability to analyze information could potentially help identify: Individuals who might be feeling disconnected or drifting, allowing for proactive outreach. Members who show indications of being ready for new steps in their faith journey or leadership roles. Furthermore, AI could assist in personalizing communication at scale. Imagine sending birthday greetings, targeted resources relevant to someone’s expressed interests (like parenting workshops or grief support groups), or reminders tailored to their involvement. When done thoughtfully, this could help individuals feel more seen and valued within a larger community. However, the crucial caveat is that AI must always support, never replace, genuine human connection. A personalized email is no substitute for a face-to-face conversation, a listening ear, or a comforting presence. The aim should be to use technology to enhance our ability to be present and personal, not to automate relationships themselves.

Issues of data privacy, consent, and the potential for bias in algorithms are paramount. We must ensure any use of technology respects the dignity and confidentiality of our members. One particularly sensitive area is sermon preparation. AI tools can certainly assist with research, finding illustrations, or even outlining initial ideas. They can function like an advanced search engine or a digital commentary. But we must draw a clear line. The pulpit is sacred ground. The message delivered should flow from the pastor’s personal study of Scripture, their relationship with God, and their connection with the specific needs and context of their congregation. Using AI to write a sermon risks sacrificing authenticity, diluting the pastor’s unique voice, and potentially bypassing the spiritual work of wrestling with the text and listening for the Spirit’s guidance. AI can be a tool in the study, perhaps, but never the source or the voice from the pulpit. Authenticity and the pastor’s personal spiritual engagement are non-negotiable.

It offers potential tools to help us manage the practical demands of ministry and perhaps even gain insights for better care. But it also requires wisdom, discernment, and a commitment to ethical principles rooted in our faith. We shouldn’t rush to embrace every new technology uncritically, nor should we reject it out of fear. Instead, let’s engage thoughtfully, asking how these tools can genuinely serve our core mission: loving God, loving people, and making disciples. As we navigate this new technological landscape, may we do so faithfully, always prioritizing genuine human connection and the authentic leading of the Holy Spirit.

As AI takes on tasks previously considered uniquely human, how does this reshape our understanding of our own identity and purpose? How do we ensure that technology serves to enhance, rather than diminish, genuine human connection and community? Can AI help us build stronger relationships, or does it risk creating further isolation? What are the implications of AI for our understanding of God’s image in humanity? If machines can learn, create, and even exhibit forms of “intelligence,” how does this impact our theological understanding of human uniqueness? How do we balance the potential benefits of AI in ministry with the ethical considerations of data privacy, consent, and potential bias? How do we ensure that technology serves all members of our community equitably? In what ways might AI challenge or reshape our understanding of spiritual disciplines like prayer, contemplation, and discernment? How do we ensure that technology enhances, rather than distracts from, our relationship with God? These are just a few of the many questions that AI raises for people of faith. As we move forward, it’s crucial that we engage in thoughtful dialogue, grounded in Scripture and guided by the Holy Spirit, to discern how we can use these powerful tools to advance God’s kingdom and serve our communities with love and wisdom.

This became super clear when we were developing an AI agent with ElevenLabs. You can learn more about their product here: ElevenLabs conversational AI agents. I strongly suggest you check them out. It’s a pretty amazing service. If you want to sign up, please use this link. It will give me a little kickback. In a nutshell, it’s an LLM linked with a realistic chatbot. Amazingly realistic! I know it’s not the same as a real person, but it can feel very, very real.

The problem? We needed to make sure the conversations didn’t go on forever since we were paying by the minute. ElevenLabs charges per minute for their service. However, no matter what we tried, the agent just could not track the time correctly. If we told it to make sure conversations didn’t go more than 12 minutes, sometimes it would go for 3, and sometimes it would go for 15. It was infuriating. I had wrongly assumed that it could keep track of time. It could not on its own! This is NOT intelligence. It is an LLM. I know LLMs feel like intelligence, but they are not!

Our solution was to use contextual updates—something that, as of this week, is on the bleeding edge of what ElevenLabs offers. You can read about them here: contextual updates. Basically, it’s a way to update the agent’s creation prompt by injecting some new information. For our project, two minutes before the time was up, the AI would get a message saying, “Start the wrap-up sequence!” This is not seen or heard by the user, but it helps direct the conversation flow. In the agent’s creation prompt, there is a specific set of instructions on how to end the conversation gracefully. Without this, the conversation would just abruptly end when the set time was up. This is not a very user-friendly or enjoyable experience. The way we have it set now, the conversation is drawn to a natural conclusion. It works like a charm! This was after months of trying to get the agents to track time. We tried using API calls to time servers, sending updated variable values to the agent, and more. These all “worked” but would sometimes cause errors or create pauses in the conversation, taking you out of the “real” experience. What’s cool is that contextual updates weren’t available when we started. I’m not sure if they added it because of me, but I actually suggested it on their Discord server, and all of a sudden, it showed up! It was really neat to be part of developing something so cutting-edge.

They process information based on the words and context you give them. This can lead to some interesting challenges when you’re trying to build a real-time conversational AI. For example, if you ask a language model about something that happened “yesterday,” it will give you an answer based on what it knows about the day before. But if you keep talking for hours, and today passes into the next day, it won’t automatically update its understanding of “yesterday” to reflect the new time. It’s weird. This is why we had to use contextual updates in our ElevenLabs agent. We needed to give the AI a little nudge to remind it that time was passing. When I asked one of the AI agents how it understood time, it could only register the timestamps when it was actively speaking. If I waited five minutes to reply and then asked how much time had passed, it might say 1 or 2 seconds. I tried leaving it for an hour once, and it said 10 seconds had passed. This is because it doesn’t understand the passage of time when there’s no active conversation! Try it. Pick an LLM and have a conversation about how much time has passed. They have no idea! So we are a long way from intelligence. A “sense” of time is part of being conscious, isn’t it?

There were many error codes, setbacks, and times when I had to start over. Before I understood that the agents didn’t have an understanding of time, I just could not make sense of things. Unexpected things happened… then I thought it was working, but it was just a fluke. But I kept going, and eventually, we got it to work. This is the way developing things goes sometimes.
