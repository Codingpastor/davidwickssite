This “behaving” carries with it a certain appearance of godliness. When you are young, the pressure is very real, and at least for me, I had a great capacity to behave and perform well. However, as I’ve aged, I have slowly lost both my ability and my desire to perform and behave. Maybe it’s a decrease in what we call “filters.” Maybe it’s caring less about what people think.

Maybe what I saw in myself, or thought I saw, wasn’t growth after all. Not only have I begun to see a deficiency in my own walk with God, but I was beginning to see a real hollowness in the church. In 2020, I was pastoring a small church in Saskatchewan. We were lifeless, stagnant, not growing, and full of what I would call real-world problems—marriage struggles in leadership, pettiness, and a slow, steady falling apart. What was going on? We were not being transformed. We were not growing naturally. Step three was not happening despite faithful attendance, serving, giving, and hearing great teaching and sermons. Despite summer camps, seminars, and being immersed in church culture, we really hadn’t grown—not as a body and not as individuals.

Right now, my total is somewhere around 905. I’ve come a long way for someone who was never really into weightlifting. The point being: I had a goal, I trained, and I got better—a lot better. When I started, my total was probably somewhere around 400-500 pounds. So is our growth in faith the same? Most of us would say no. We would say that isn’t how our faith walk works. We would say to train with a goal and with intensity would make us like monks or would move us into what we call (and are very afraid of) “works-based salvation”—religious like a Buddhist or a Muslim earning favor with God through works.

The world is changing at lightning speed, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer science fiction – it’s becoming part of our daily lives. From how we shop to how we get news, AI is everywhere. As people of faith, and particularly as pastors, this rapid advancement prompts important questions: How do we engage with this powerful technology? Can it be a tool for ministry, or does it pose risks we need to carefully consider? As a pastor myself, I’ve been pondering how AI might intersect with my calling. I see two main areas where AI could potentially play a role: easing the administrative burdens of ministry and, perhaps more profoundly, helping us connect with and care for our congregations more effectively.

Could AI help? Tools are emerging that can automate scheduling, draft initial communications (like event reminders or newsletters), and manage calendars. But the area I find most intriguing, and perhaps most complex, is using database management to help track and care for people i– what I sometimes call (with pastoral affection!) “sheep management.” Imagine moving beyond simple contact lists. Could AI help us, ethically and with appropriate permissions, keep better track of our congregants’ journeys? Noting significant life events, like a birth, a new job, or, sadly, a loss in the family, prompting timely pastoral care. Identifying patterns, like someone who hasn’t attended in a while, suggesting a need for a personal check-in. Understanding engagement levels to better connect people with relevant groups or service opportunities. The goal here isn’t cold efficiency but liberating time and providing insights to enable more focused, personal, and timely pastoral care.

AI in Pastoral Care Beyond administration, could AI actually help foster a deeper sense of connection within the church community? This idea requires even more careful thought.

Members who show indications of being ready for new steps in their faith journey or leadership roles. Furthermore, AI could assist in personalizing communication at scale. Imagine sending birthday greetings, targeted resources relevant to someone’s expressed interests (like parenting workshops or grief support groups), or reminders tailored to their involvement. When done thoughtfully, this could help individuals feel more seen and valued within a larger community. However, the crucial caveat is that AI must always support, never replace, genuine human connection.

Our solution was to use contextual updates—something that, as of this week, is on the bleeding edge of what ElevenLabs offers. You can read about them here: contextual updates. Basically, it’s a way to update the agent’s creation prompt by injecting some new information. For our project, two minutes before the time was up, the AI would get a message saying, “Start the wrap-up sequence!” This is not seen or heard by the user, but it helps direct the conversation flow. In the agent’s creation prompt, there is a specific set of instructions on how to end the conversation gracefully. Without this, the conversation would just abruptly end when the set time was up (which can be hard-coded) or the conversation would just go on forever. This is not a very user-friendly or enjoyable experience. The way we have it set now, the conversation is drawn to a natural conclusion. It works like a charm! This was after months of trying to get the agents to track time. We tried using API calls to time servers, sending updated variable values to the agent, and more. These all “worked” but would sometimes cause errors or create pauses in the conversation, taking you out of the “real” experience. What’s cool is that contextual updates weren’t available when we started. I’m not sure if they added it because of me, but I actually suggested it on their Discord server, and all of a sudden, it showed up!

For example, if you ask a language model about something that happened “yesterday,” it will give you an answer based on what it knows about the day before. But if you keep talking for hours, and today passes into the next day, it won’t automatically update its understanding of “yesterday” to reflect the new time. It’s weird. This is why we had to use contextual updates in our ElevenLabs agent. We needed to give the AI a little nudge to remind it that time was passing. When I asked one of the AI agents how it understood time, it could only register the timestamps when it was actively speaking. If I waited five minutes to reply and then asked how much time had passed, it might say 1 or 2 seconds. I tried leaving it for an hour once, and it said 10 seconds had passed. This is because it doesn’t understand the passage of time when there’s no active conversation! Try it. Pick an LLM and have a conversation about how much time has passed. They have no idea!
