It was a precious moment for me. Because I know that in just a matter of years, we won’t be having these times together. These conversations that start about his performance quickly become deeper—discussions about his character, his feelings of self-worth, about feeling empowered to live life, achieve things, and do hard things.

My response is simple: “You spend your money on that. I spend my money on hockey.” Because hockey gives me time with my kids. And I love it. I love cheering for them. I love the community that hockey brings—the other hockey parents, the shared experiences. If I didn’t have hockey, there’s a really good chance I wouldn’t get out on certain evenings.

I’d say hockey is one of the last places for a young person to experience what I’d call reward and consequence. If they work hard, if they practice, if they do their best, there’s a really good chance their team will do well or win. They’ll get some recognition, some affirmation. They’ll feel strong and empowered. But on the flip side, hockey also provides an environment where if they don’t work hard, if they don’t try, if they skip practices—there’s a real chance they’ll make mistakes or won’t be able to do what they want to do. They might lose. I think those are valuable lessons on both sides. Unfortunately, what I’m seeing in the school system is that everyone wins, everyone gets participation recognition, and there’s “no such thing as losing.” Everyone just has to “do their best.” But that’s not how the world works. That’s not how businesses work. That’s not how life works. You can’t always just win. Sometimes you have to sacrifice. Sometimes you have to work hard and develop yourself to get somewhere.

Here are some constructive ways pastors can ethically leverage AI: Processing and Organizing: Turn scattered notes or rough ideas into a structured outline. Refining Transitions: Smooth the connections between different sections of your sermon. Proofreading: Check for grammar, spelling mistakes, and awkward phrasing. Research Assistance: Quickly gather background information on historical context or specific scripture passages. Brainstorming Titles: Generate creative sermon title options based on your main points. Summarizing Research: Condense lengthy articles, commentaries, or book chapters for quick review.

AI presents both an opportunity and a challenge. When used thoughtfully and ethically, it can enhance our effectiveness without compromising our integrity. The key is maintaining proper boundaries and prioritizing our spiritual disciplines. Remember, your congregation doesn’t primarily need perfectly polished content generated in seconds. They need a pastor who has genuinely encountered God and faithfully shares what they’ve heard. They hunger for authentic spiritual leadership that technology alone cannot provide. I’m reminded of A.W. Tozer who said: “Between the scribe who has read and the prophet who has seen there is a difference as wide as the sea. We are today overrun with orthodox scribes, but the prophets, where are they? The hard voice of the scribe sounds over evangelicalism, but the Church waits for the tender voice of the saint who has penetrated the veil and has gazed with inward eye upon the Wonder that is God. And yet, thus to penetrate, to push in sensitive living experience into the holy Presence, is a privilege open to every child of God.” ― The Pursuit of God The scribe could be fueled by and aided by AI… but the prophet, would have no need for it. AI can come and go, the prophet would only continue to do the work of God. Here are some practical guidelines for ethical AI use in sermon preparation as a start and will need to be refined: Start with Prayer and Scripture: Always begin your preparation with personal prayer and time in God’s Word before turning to any technological assistance. Let Your Voice Remain Dominant: Ensure the final sermon reflects your personal theology, your communication style, and your unique relationship with your congregation. Adapt, rewrite, and make it your own. AI has a tone - it is overly positive, authoritative and lacks nuance. Don’t get drowned out. Consider Transparency: You might occasionally share with your congregation (appropriately) how you use technological tools to enhance your preparation process. This would likely be a scary step for some pastors. Set Clear Boundaries: Decide beforehand which tasks are appropriate for AI assistance and which remain exclusively your spiritual responsibility (e.g., core message discernment, personal application). Use for Enhancement, Not Replacement: Let AI handle administrative or refining tasks while you focus on the spiritual heart of your message—listening to God and connecting with His people. The future of ministry will likely belong to those who neither blindly reject technological innovation nor uncritically surrender to it, but instead learn to use it wisely and faithfully in service of their divine calling. AI can help refine how we communicate God’s word, but it can never replace the irreplaceable: a pastor who listens to God’s voice and faithfully shares what they’ve heard with God’s people. This is and will be an ongoing issue for pastors, and the discussion is only beginning. I wonder if we need to start developing a “AI Oath” that we sign to help us as pastors stay grounded and to stay transparent how we will engage with and use this technology.

The world is changing at lightning speed, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer science fiction – it’s becoming part of our daily lives. From how we shop to how we get news, AI is everywhere. As people of faith, and particularly as pastors, this rapid advancement prompts important questions: How do we engage with this powerful technology? Can it be a tool for ministry, or does it pose risks we need to carefully consider? As a pastor myself, I’ve been pondering how AI might intersect with my calling. I see two main areas where AI could potentially play a role: easing the administrative burdens of ministry and, perhaps more profoundly, helping us connect with and care for our congregations more effectively. But alongside any potential benefits, we must tread thoughtfully and ethically.

Scheduling meetings, coordinating volunteers, sending communications, and managing resources – these tasks are necessary but can consume valuable time that could be spent in prayer, study, or directly ministering to people. Could AI help? Tools are emerging that can automate scheduling, draft initial communications (like event reminders or newsletters), and manage calendars. But the area I find most intriguing, and perhaps most complex, is using database management to help track and care for people i– what I sometimes call (with pastoral affection!) “sheep management.” Imagine moving beyond simple contact lists. Could AI help us, ethically and with appropriate permissions, keep better track of our congregants’ journeys? Noting significant life events, like a birth, a new job, or, sadly, a loss in the family, prompting timely pastoral care. Identifying patterns, like someone who hasn’t attended in a while, suggesting a need for a personal check-in. Understanding engagement levels to better connect people with relevant groups or service opportunities. The goal here isn’t cold efficiency but liberating time and providing insights to enable more focused, personal, and timely pastoral care. It’s about using tools to help us better fulfill the shepherd’s call to know and care for the flock.

AI in Pastoral Care Beyond administration, could AI actually help foster a deeper sense of connection within the church community? This idea requires even more careful thought. AI’s ability to analyze information could potentially help identify: Individuals who might be feeling disconnected or drifting, allowing for proactive outreach. Members who show indications of being ready for new steps in their faith journey or leadership roles. Furthermore, AI could assist in personalizing communication at scale. Imagine sending birthday greetings, targeted resources relevant to someone’s expressed interests (like parenting workshops or grief support groups), or reminders tailored to their involvement. When done thoughtfully, this could help individuals feel more seen and valued within a larger community. However, the crucial caveat is that AI must always support, never replace, genuine human connection. A personalized email is no substitute for a face-to-face conversation, a listening ear, or a comforting presence.

They can function like an advanced search engine or a digital commentary. But we must draw a clear line. The pulpit is sacred ground. The message delivered should flow from the pastor’s personal study of Scripture, their relationship with God, and their connection with the specific needs and context of their congregation. Using AI to write a sermon risks sacrificing authenticity, diluting the pastor’s unique voice, and potentially bypassing the spiritual work of wrestling with the text and listening for the Spirit’s guidance.

The problem? We needed to make sure the conversations didn’t go on forever since we were paying by the minute. ElevenLabs charges per minute for their service using a credit system. However, no matter what we tried, the agent just could not track the time correctly. If we told it to make sure conversations didn’t go more than 12 minutes, sometimes it would go for 3, and sometimes it would go for 15. It was infuriating. I had wrongly assumed that it could keep track of time. It could not on its own! This is NOT intelligence. It is an LLM. I know LLMs feel like intelligence, but they are not… well not quite.

Our solution was to use contextual updates—something that, as of this week, is on the bleeding edge of what ElevenLabs offers. You can read about them here: contextual updates. Basically, it’s a way to update the agent’s creation prompt by injecting some new information. For our project, two minutes before the time was up, the AI would get a message saying, “Start the wrap-up sequence!” This is not seen or heard by the user, but it helps direct the conversation flow. In the agent’s creation prompt, there is a specific set of instructions on how to end the conversation gracefully. Without this, the conversation would just abruptly end when the set time was up (which can be hard-coded) or the conversation would just go on forever. This is not a very user-friendly or enjoyable experience. The way we have it set now, the conversation is drawn to a natural conclusion. It works like a charm! This was after months of trying to get the agents to track time. We tried using API calls to time servers, sending updated variable values to the agent, and more. These all “worked” but would sometimes cause errors or create pauses in the conversation, taking you out of the “real” experience. What’s cool is that contextual updates weren’t available when we started. I’m not sure if they added it because of me, but I actually suggested it on their Discord server, and all of a sudden, it showed up! It was really neat to be part of developing something so cutting-edge.

They process information based on the words and context you give them. This can lead to some interesting challenges when you’re trying to build a real-time conversational AI. For example, if you ask a language model about something that happened “yesterday,” it will give you an answer based on what it knows about the day before. But if you keep talking for hours, and today passes into the next day, it won’t automatically update its understanding of “yesterday” to reflect the new time. It’s weird. This is why we had to use contextual updates in our ElevenLabs agent. We needed to give the AI a little nudge to remind it that time was passing. When I asked one of the AI agents how it understood time, it could only register the timestamps when it was actively speaking. If I waited five minutes to reply and then asked how much time had passed, it might say 1 or 2 seconds. I tried leaving it for an hour once, and it said 10 seconds had passed. This is because it doesn’t understand the passage of time when there’s no active conversation! Try it. Pick an LLM and have a conversation about how much time has passed. They have no idea! So we are a long way from intelligence. A “sense” of time is part of being conscious, isn’t it?
