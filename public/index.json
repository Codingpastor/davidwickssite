Here are some constructive ways pastors can ethically leverage AI: Processing and Organizing: Turn scattered notes or rough ideas into a structured outline. Refining Transitions: Smooth the connections between different sections of your sermon. Proofreading: Check for grammar, spelling mistakes, and awkward phrasing. Research Assistance: Quickly gather background information on historical context or specific scripture passages. Brainstorming Titles: Generate creative sermon title options based on your main points. Summarizing Research: Condense lengthy articles, commentaries, or book chapters for quick review.

The temptation for overworked, busy pastors is immense: let AI do the heavy lifting. But when used properly, AI handles mechanical tasks, freeing you for the irreplaceable work of prayer, biblical meditation, and listening to God’s voice. The sermon that truly touches hearts doesn’t come from sophisticated algorithms; it comes from a pastor who has first been touched by God.

AI presents both an opportunity and a challenge. When used thoughtfully and ethically, it can enhance our effectiveness without compromising our integrity. The key is maintaining proper boundaries and prioritizing our spiritual disciplines. Remember, your congregation doesn’t primarily need perfectly polished content generated in seconds. They need a pastor who has genuinely encountered God and faithfully shares what they’ve heard. They hunger for authentic spiritual leadership that technology alone cannot provide. I’m reminded of A.W. Tozer who said: “Between the scribe who has read and the prophet who has seen there is a difference as wide as the sea. We are today overrun with orthodox scribes, but the prophets, where are they? The hard voice of the scribe sounds over evangelicalism, but the Church waits for the tender voice of the saint who has penetrated the veil and has gazed with inward eye upon the Wonder that is God. And yet, thus to penetrate, to push in sensitive living experience into the holy Presence, is a privilege open to every child of God.” ― The Pursuit of God The scribe could be fueled by and aided by AI… but the prophet, would have no need for it. AI can come and go, the prophet would only continue to do the work of God. Here are some practical guidelines for ethical AI use in sermon preparation as a start and will need to be refined: Start with Prayer and Scripture: Always begin your preparation with personal prayer and time in God’s Word before turning to any technological assistance. Let Your Voice Remain Dominant: Ensure the final sermon reflects your personal theology, your communication style, and your unique relationship with your congregation. Adapt, rewrite, and make it your own. AI has a tone - it is overly positive, authoritative and lacks nuance. Don’t get drowned out. Consider Transparency: You might occasionally share with your congregation (appropriately) how you use technological tools to enhance your preparation process. This would likely be a scary step for some pastors. Set Clear Boundaries: Decide beforehand which tasks are appropriate for AI assistance and which remain exclusively your spiritual responsibility (e.g., core message discernment, personal application). Use for Enhancement, Not Replacement: Let AI handle administrative or refining tasks while you focus on the spiritual heart of your message—listening to God and connecting with His people. The future of ministry will likely belong to those who neither blindly reject technological innovation nor uncritically surrender to it, but instead learn to use it wisely and faithfully in service of their divine calling. AI can help refine how we communicate God’s word, but it can never replace the irreplaceable: a pastor who listens to God’s voice and faithfully shares what they’ve heard with God’s people. This is and will be an ongoing issue for pastors, and the discussion is only beginning. I wonder if we need to start developing a “AI Oath” that we sign to help us as pastors stay grounded and to stay transparent how we will engage with and use this technology.

Maybe what I saw in myself, or thought I saw, wasn’t growth after all. Not only have I begun to see a deficiency in my own walk with God, but I was beginning to see a real hollowness in the church. In 2020, I was pastoring a small church in Saskatchewan. We were lifeless, stagnant, not growing, and full of what I would call real-world problems—marriage struggles in leadership, pettiness, and a slow, steady falling apart. What was going on? We were not being transformed. We were not growing naturally. Step three was not happening despite faithful attendance, serving, giving, and hearing great teaching and sermons.

We shouldn’t rush to embrace every new technology uncritically, nor should we reject it out of fear. Instead, let’s engage thoughtfully, asking how these tools can genuinely serve our core mission: loving God, loving people, and making disciples. As we navigate this new technological landscape, may we do so faithfully, always prioritizing genuine human connection and the authentic leading of the Holy Spirit.

As AI takes on tasks previously considered uniquely human, how does this reshape our understanding of our own identity and purpose? How do we ensure that technology serves to enhance, rather than diminish, genuine human connection and community? Can AI help us build stronger relationships, or does it risk creating further isolation? What are the implications of AI for our understanding of God’s image in humanity? If machines can learn, create, and even exhibit forms of “intelligence,” how does this impact our theological understanding of human uniqueness? How do we balance the potential benefits of AI in ministry with the ethical considerations of data privacy, consent, and potential bias? How do we ensure that technology serves all members of our community equitably? In what ways might AI challenge or reshape our understanding of spiritual disciplines like prayer, contemplation, and discernment? How do we ensure that technology enhances, rather than distracts from, our relationship with God? These are just a few of the many questions that AI raises for people of faith. As we move forward, it’s crucial that we engage in thoughtful dialogue, grounded in Scripture and guided by the Holy Spirit, to discern how we can use these powerful tools to advance God’s kingdom and serve our communities with love and wisdom.

This became super clear when we were developing an AI agent with ElevenLabs. You can learn more about their product here: ElevenLabs conversational AI agents. I strongly suggest you check them out. It’s a pretty amazing service. If you want to sign up, please use this link, it will help support me a little bit. In a nutshell, it’s an LLM linked with a realistic chatbot. Amazingly realistic! I know it’s not the same as a real person, but it can feel very, very real.

The problem? We needed to make sure the conversations didn’t go on forever since we were paying by the minute. ElevenLabs charges per minute for their service using a credit system. However, no matter what we tried, the agent just could not track the time correctly. If we told it to make sure conversations didn’t go more than 12 minutes, sometimes it would go for 3, and sometimes it would go for 15. It was infuriating. I had wrongly assumed that it could keep track of time. It could not on its own! This is NOT intelligence. It is an LLM. I know LLMs feel like intelligence, but they are not… well not quite.

Our solution was to use contextual updates—something that, as of this week, is on the bleeding edge of what ElevenLabs offers. You can read about them here: contextual updates. Basically, it’s a way to update the agent’s creation prompt by injecting some new information. For our project, two minutes before the time was up, the AI would get a message saying, “Start the wrap-up sequence!” This is not seen or heard by the user, but it helps direct the conversation flow. In the agent’s creation prompt, there is a specific set of instructions on how to end the conversation gracefully. Without this, the conversation would just abruptly end when the set time was up (which can be hard-coded) or the conversation would just go on forever. This is not a very user-friendly or enjoyable experience. The way we have it set now, the conversation is drawn to a natural conclusion. It works like a charm! This was after months of trying to get the agents to track time. We tried using API calls to time servers, sending updated variable values to the agent, and more. These all “worked” but would sometimes cause errors or create pauses in the conversation, taking you out of the “real” experience. What’s cool is that contextual updates weren’t available when we started. I’m not sure if they added it because of me, but I actually suggested it on their Discord server, and all of a sudden, it showed up! It was really neat to be part of developing something so cutting-edge.

They process information based on the words and context you give them. This can lead to some interesting challenges when you’re trying to build a real-time conversational AI. For example, if you ask a language model about something that happened “yesterday,” it will give you an answer based on what it knows about the day before. But if you keep talking for hours, and today passes into the next day, it won’t automatically update its understanding of “yesterday” to reflect the new time. It’s weird. This is why we had to use contextual updates in our ElevenLabs agent. We needed to give the AI a little nudge to remind it that time was passing. When I asked one of the AI agents how it understood time, it could only register the timestamps when it was actively speaking. If I waited five minutes to reply and then asked how much time had passed, it might say 1 or 2 seconds. I tried leaving it for an hour once, and it said 10 seconds had passed. This is because it doesn’t understand the passage of time when there’s no active conversation! Try it. Pick an LLM and have a conversation about how much time has passed. They have no idea! So we are a long way from intelligence. A “sense” of time is part of being conscious, isn’t it?

There were many error codes, setbacks, and times when I had to start over. Before I understood that the agents didn’t have an understanding of time, I just could not make sense of things. Unexpected things happened… then I thought it was working, but it was just a fluke. But I kept going, and eventually, we got it to work. This is the way developing things goes sometimes.
