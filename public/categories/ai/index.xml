<p>In the quiet hours before dawn, Pastor David sits at his desk reviewing reports, making decisions on facility issues, and finalizing next month&rsquo;s ministry calendar. His sermon preparation—the work he feels truly called to do—sits untouched in the corner.</p>
<p><em>Ok a little theatric, but not far from the truth on some days.</em></p>
<p>Despite having dedicated staff and volunteers who handle many day-to-day tasks, this scene plays out in countless churches across the country, where pastors still find themselves shouldering administrative responsibilities that pull them away from their primary calling.</p>]]></description>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) are amazing, but they have a funny quirk: they don&rsquo;t really understand the passage of time within a conversation. This became super clear when we were developing an AI agent with ElevenLabs. You can learn more about their product here: <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">ElevenLabs conversational AI agents</a>. I strongly suggest you check them out. It&rsquo;s a pretty amazing service. If you want to sign up, please use <a href="https://try.elevenlabs.io/davidwicks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">this link</a>, it will help support me a little bit. In a nutshell, it&rsquo;s an LLM linked with a realistic chatbot. Amazingly realistic! I know it&rsquo;s not the same as a real person, but it can feel very, very real.</p>]]></description>
