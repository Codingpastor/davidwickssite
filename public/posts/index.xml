<p>Here is something I&rsquo;ve been thinking about for a long, long time: train yourself to be godly.</p>
<h2 id="the-common-flawed-assumption-about-spiritual-growth">The Common (Flawed) Assumption About Spiritual Growth</h2>
<p>In my early years, I adopted a view of spiritual growth that goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Say a sinner&rsquo;s prayer</li>
<li>Jesus comes into your heart</li>
<li>Grow closer to God over time</li>
<li>Go to heaven</li>
</ol>
<p>I can&rsquo;t argue with steps one and two. Nor could I argue with steps 3 and 4. However, step three is based on a major assumption—that it happens <em>naturally</em>.</p>]]></description>

<p>In the quiet hours before dawn, Pastor David sits at his desk reviewing reports, making decisions on facility issues, and finalizing next month&rsquo;s ministry calendar. His sermon preparation—the work he feels truly called to do—sits untouched in the corner.</p>
<p><em>Ok a little theatric, but not far from the truth on some days.</em></p>
<p>Despite having dedicated staff and volunteers who handle many day-to-day tasks, this scene plays out in countless churches across the country, where pastors still find themselves shouldering administrative responsibilities that pull them away from their primary calling.</p>]]></description>

<p>The world is changing at lightning speed, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer science fiction – it&rsquo;s becoming part of our daily lives. From how we shop to how we get news, AI is everywhere. As people of faith, and particularly as pastors, this rapid advancement prompts important questions: How do we engage with this powerful technology? Can it be a tool for ministry, or does it pose risks we need to carefully consider?</p>]]></description>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) are amazing, but they have a funny quirk: they don&rsquo;t really understand the passage of time within a conversation. This became super clear when we were developing an AI agent with ElevenLabs. You can learn more about their product here: <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">ElevenLabs conversational AI agents</a>. I strongly suggest you check them out. It&rsquo;s a pretty amazing service. If you want to sign up, please use <a href="https://try.elevenlabs.io/davidwicks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">this link</a>, it will help support me a little bit. In a nutshell, it&rsquo;s an LLM linked with a realistic chatbot. Amazingly realistic! I know it&rsquo;s not the same as a real person, but it can feel very, very real.</p>]]></description>
