      <description>The Hidden Burden: How Administrative Tasks Drain Pastoral Energy In the quiet hours before dawn, Pastor David sits at his desk reviewing reports, making decisions on facility issues, and finalizing next month&amp;rsquo;s ministry calendar. His sermon preparation—the work he feels truly called to do—sits untouched in the corner.&#xA;Ok a little theatric, but not far from the truth on some days.&#xA;Despite having dedicated staff and volunteers who handle many day-to-day tasks, this scene plays out in countless churches across the country, where pastors still find themselves shouldering administrative responsibilities that pull them away from their primary calling.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty amazing service.</description>
